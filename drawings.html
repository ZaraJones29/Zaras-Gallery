            <h2> Drawings </h2>
            <p>My main focus right now is marker and fineliner art. I really enjoy making this type of art because it is easy and quick to make. 
                I can quickly make a sketch or drawing in my drawing book with some markers and fineliners, which ultimately looks good.
                You can really see my art style coming through, because I like to draw plants or other objects with faces. I mainly use bright colors for these types of drawings, 
                but occasionally I only use a black fineliner. I mainly get my inspiration from Pinterest, but also other things in my environment.
                Below you can see some drawings I made.

            <h3>Art supplies I use for making my drawings</h3>
            <p>
                For my colored drawings I mainly use the fineliners and markers from Stabilo, because they are nice to draw with and they usually donâ€™t bleed through. The colors are also very vibrant, which I like. 
                I also sometimes use the promarkers from Winsor & Newton. I use these less often because they bleed through, but they are nice to work with and very pigmented.
                If I want to make a work with only black fineliner, I use Staedtler or the Sakura Pigma Micron fineliners.
                I enjoy working with these fineliners and markers the most.
