            <h2> Paintings </h2>
            <p> One of the things I've been doing since I was a little kid is painting. I remember sitting at the table with a large sheet of paper and some paint in front of me. 
                I immediately started painting and had a blast. When I was done and the paint dried, I was always really proud of myself.
                I still enjoy painting, but I do it less these days. I can really sit in my room for hours and work on a painting. 
                Sometimes I don't even realize that I have been working for almost 4 hours. I just really wanted to finish my painting and see the end result.
                Below you can see some paintings I made.
            </p>

            <h3>Art supplies I use for making my paintings</h3>
            <p>
                I mainly use acrylic paint from the brand Amsterdam. I really like using this paint, because it is not too thick or too watery and it blends well. It is very easy to work with it. 
                For my graffiti wall, I used the graffiti spray cans from Amsterdam. When I start a painting I usually have an inspiration photo that I first sketch on the canvas with pencil. 
                After this I usually paint the background first and then what is in the foreground.
                Many artists work in layers, so they paint the main color first and then the details. I usually paint the details in small pieces right away. I like this better than working with different layers.
                I sometimes also use watercolor. I then use the paint from the Van Gogh brand. This paint is very pigmented and nice to work with.

            <h2> Make-up looks</h2>
            <p> I consider make-up to be a form of art. It's a bit like painting, but instead of paint you use eyeshadow or lipstick. I really
                enjoy doing my make-up and it can be quite relaxing for me, which is why it's also one of my hobbies. People always ask me why it
                takes me so long to do my make-up looks and if I get bored while doing it, but they don't realize that I really enjoy doing it and 
                don't really realize how long it is taking. Of couse, how long it takes differs in terms of which make-up looks I'm doing, but it doesn't
                matter to me. I never get tired of it or find it boring.
                Below you can see some make-up looks I created.
