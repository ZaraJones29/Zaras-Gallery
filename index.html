            <h2>Paintings</h2>
            <p>One of the things I've been doing since I was a little kid is painting. I remember sitting at the table with a large sheet of paper and some paint in front of me. 
                I immediately started painting and had a blast. When I was done and the paint dried, I was always really proud of myself.
                I still enjoy painting, but I do it less these days. I can really sit in my room for hours and work on a painting. 
                Sometimes I don't even realize that I have been working for almost 4 hours. I just really wanted to finish my painting and see the end result.
                Below you can see some paintings I made.

            <h2>Marker and fineliner art</h2>
            <p>My main focus right now is marker and fineliner art. I really enjoy making this type of art because it is easy and quick to make. 
                I can quickly make a sketch or drawing in my drawing book with some markers and fineliners, which ultimately looks good.
                You can really see my art style coming through, because I like to draw plants or other objects with faces. I mainly use bright colors for these types of drawings, 
                but occasionally I only use a black fineliner. I mainly get my inspiration from Pinterest, but also other things in my environment.
                Below you can see some drawings I made.

            <h2>Make-up</h2>
            <p> I consider make-up to be a form of art. It's a bit like painting, but instead of paint you use eyeshadow or lipstick. I really
                enjoy doing my make-up and it can be quite relaxing for me, which is why it's also one of my hobbies. People always ask me why it
                takes me so long to do my make-up looks and if I get bored while doing it, but they don't realize that I really enjoy doing it and 
                don't really realize how long it is taking. Of couse, how long it takes differs in terms of which make-up looks I'm doing, but it doesn't
                matter to me. I never get tired of it or find it boring.
                Below you can see some make-up looks I created.
