            <p>
                The thing I enjoy most at the moment is making drawings with markers and fineliners. 
                With these art supplies I can quickly make a drawing in my sketchbook. I can also easily take them anywhere, not like with paint.

            <p> I have been painting since I can remember. My parents have kept all my paintings from the past and I still enjoy looking at them. Of course I've gotten better, so I like seeing the progress. 
                I've been doing it less lately, because it takes a lot of time.
