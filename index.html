            <p>
                The thing I enjoy most at the moment is making drawings with markers and fineliners. 
                With these art supplies I can quickly make a drawing in my sketchbook. I can also easily take them anywhere, not like with paint.

            <p> One of the things I've been doing since I was a little kid is painting. I remember sitting at the table with a large sheet of paper and some paint in front of me. 
                I immediately started painting and had a blast. When I was done and the paint dried, I was always really proud of myself.
                I still enjoy painting, but I do it less these days. I can really sit in my room for hours and work on a painting. 
                Sometimes I don't even realize that I have been working for almost 4 hours. I just really wanted to finish my painting and see the end result.
                Below you can see some paintings I made.
